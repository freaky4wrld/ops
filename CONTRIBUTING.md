# **How to Contribute to DevOps**

Below are guidelines for contributing to the ops (DevOps) repository hosted on GitHub. These guidelines are primarily recommendations rather than strict rules. Use your discretion and feel free to suggest changes to this document by submitting a pull request.

**This guide assumes that you have finished the onboarding process, which involves joining the Hack for LA Slack, GitHub, and Google Drive. If you haven't completed onboarding yet, please visit the [Getting Started Page](https://www.hackforla.org/getting-started).**

**The team recommends using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as the preferred text editor for working on code, but feel free to utilize a text editor of your preference.**

**If you have any additional questions about your contribution process, please feel free to reach out to the team in the [#ops](https://hackforla.slack.com/archives/CV7QGL66B) Slack channel.**
